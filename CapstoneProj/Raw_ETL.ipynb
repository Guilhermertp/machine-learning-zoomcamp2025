    "## 🚦  Interstate Traffic Dataset (US)\n",
    "Hourly data on the traffic volume for a major interstate highway in the US\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "```\n",
    "This dataset contains hourly data on the traffic volume for westbound I-94, a major interstate highway in the US that connects Minneapolis and St Paul, Minnesota. The data was collected by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) from 2012 to 2018 at a station roughly midway between the two cities.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* holiday: a categorical variable that indicates whether the date is a US national holiday or a regional holiday (such as the Minnesota State Fair).\n",
    "* temp: a numeric variable that shows the average temperature in kelvin.\n",
    "* rain_1h: a numeric variable that shows the amount of rain in mm that occurred in the hour.\n",
    "* snow_1h: a numeric variable that shows the amount of snow in mm that occurred in the hour.\n",
    "* clouds_all: a numeric variable that shows the percentage of cloud cover.\n",
    "* weather_main: a categorical variable that gives a short textual description of the current weather (such as Clear, Clouds, Rain, etc.).\n",
    "* weather_description: a categorical variable that gives a longer textual description of the current weather (such as light rain, overcast clouds, etc.).\n",
    "* date_time: a datetime variable that shows the hour of the data collected in local CST time.\n",
    "* traffic_volume: a numeric variable that shows the hourly I-94 reported westbound traffic volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset can be used for regression tasks to predict the traffic volume based on the weather and holiday features. It can also be used for exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends of traffic volume over time and across different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>The <b>dataset</b> is available in</u> : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/metro-interstate-traffic-volume/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains hour-by-hour counts of vehicles traveling west on Interstate 94, measured by MnDOT’s Automatic Traffic Recorder station #301, which is located approximately in the middle of Minneapolis and St. Paul. It also includes hourly weather data and holiday information so analysts can understand how these factors affect traffic flow.
